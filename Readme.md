## Shell Script to Kill webMethods Integration Server Processes

This is a shell script that is designed to kill the webMethods Integration Server processes. The script performs the following actions:

- Checks whether the current user is "wmadmin" or not. If not, the script exits.

- Determines the directory for the Integration Server by checking if specific directories exist.

- Finds Integration Server processes and kills them using the "kill" command.'

- Finds the WmDeployer process and kills it.

- Removes the "LOCKFILE" from the Integration Server directory, if it exists.

- Displays a message that the Integration Server is shut down.

The script is useful for stopping the Integration Server in situations where it may be causing issues or needs to be restarted.** However, it's important to note that using the "kill -9" command can force a process to stop abruptly and may cause data loss or corruption, so it should be used with caution**. Additionally, this script assumes a specific directory structure for the Integration Server, so it may need to be modified to work with different versions or configurations of the software.
